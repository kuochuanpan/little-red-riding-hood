# Git Workflow:

`Branches`: Each team will create a new branch for their work on a specific chapter. In this semester, let's start from the branch `main-comphyslab-113`.

`Commits`: Team members will commit their changes regularly as they write their parts of the story. Each commit should have a descriptive message indicating the changes made.

`Pull Requests`: Once a team has finished writing their chapter, they will create a pull request to merge their branch into the main stroy branch. Other teams will review the changes and provide feedback before merging.

`Merging`: After all chapters have been written and reviewed, one team will merge the pull requests into the main stroy branch to assemble the complete story.

`Rotate`: Once a team has done their chapter, they could rotate to the next chapter.

# Story Modifications:

In this modified version of "Little Red Riding Hood," the team can introduce new twists or elements to the story to make it more unique and engaging. For example:

Little Red Riding Hood could possess some magical powers or special abilities.
The woodcutter might have a secret past or hidden motivations.
The wolf could be a misunderstood character with his own tragic backstory.
These modifications will allow team members to exercise their creativity and storytelling skills while staying true to the spirit of the original tale.
